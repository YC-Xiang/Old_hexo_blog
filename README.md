# YC-Xiang.github.io

**branch source**: source files to generate the website. Need ‘**git push‘** to keep the files updated while switching between different computers. 
After git clone the files, maybe need to run:
```
rm -rf node_modules && npm install --force
```

**branch main**: files generated by ’**hexo d’** which don't need to care.
